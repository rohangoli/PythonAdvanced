## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        N=len(nums)
        
        # if N<=1:
        #     return N
        
        i=1
        j=1
        while i<N:
            if nums[i]!=nums[i-1]:
                nums[j]=nums[i]
                j+=1
            i+=1
            
        return j
