## Guess Number Higher or Lower

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6

# Example 2:
# Input: n = 1, pick = 1
# Output: 1

# Example 3:
# Input: n = 2, pick = 1
# Output: 1

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:
